# TUI Crew Portal (Frontend)

## Setup

1. Unzip this folder
2. Run the following:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages on the `gh-pages` branch (or use `npm run deploy` if gh-pages is installed)

**Note:** This expects the backend to be hosted at:
```
https://your-railway-backend.up.railway.app
```

Change that URL in `src/App.js` if needed.
